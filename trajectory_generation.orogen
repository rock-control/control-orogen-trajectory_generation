# This task generates a feasible, time-stamped trajectory to a given a target (joint position/velocity or Cartesian position/velocity, depending on the subclass used).
# "Feasible" means here that the output trajectory (command port) will respect the motion constraints defined by the motion_constraints-property, that is maximum/minimum
# position (only Reflexxes TypeIV), maximum speed, maximum acceleration and maximum jerk (derivative of acceleration, again only Reflexxes TypeIV). Note that RML
# is meant to be used ONLY for reactive motions with quickly changing, but discrete target points. Examples are sensor-based (e.g. Visual Servoing) or
# point-to-point motions. RML is not meant to be used for interpolating full trajectories.
#
# Note: The quality of the trajectory depends on the accuracy of this component's period. Real-time systems may significantly improve performance.
# Also not that the robot should always be able to follow the given trajectory. The current state of the robot will NOT be considered at runtime,
# simply because RML is not meant to be used this way.
#
# Before using this component, please refer to the RML documentation on http://www.reflexxes.ws
